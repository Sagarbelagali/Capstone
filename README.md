Scope 

The scope of the work is predicting the house price with the given data set and variables,  also by creating some additional variables using the learnt skill sets, and getting a hands on experience of predictive analysis and data science skill sets to help the stake holders of the real estate industry for their advantage. Since the data is limited the model will also be limited to the boundaries of the data provided. And the actual price of the houses has a lot more variability factor as than we can collect as a data set, given the limitation and confidence interval we can still try to come closer to the actual prices by predicting it beforehand and reducing the gap using the data science techniques finally working towards benefitting the real stake holders. 


Objective

The purpose of the project is to predict house prices, given the data set. The model created will learn from the data and be able to predict the housing price, given all the other metrics. Take advantage of all data set and guidelines available, use it to analyse and predict house prices, to successfully complete the capstone project taken.
